# CHALLENGE MERCADO LIBRE


## MUTANT DETECTOR API

MAGNETO wants to recruit as many mutants as possible to be able to fight the X-MEN.

And to achieve this objective, the development and implementation of this API was carried out in order to be able to detect through a sequence of characters that represent a size table (NxN) where the rows and columns refer to the base nitrogen of DNA, if the DNA corresponds to that of a human or that of a mutant.

To carry out this detection between whether it is a mutant or a human, the following consideration must be taken into account, and that is that it has already been fully identified that a DNA sequence corresponds to that of a mutant if and only if within the corresponding table more than one sequence of 4 identical letters is found in the DNA sequence, in any of the following ways: horizontal, vertical or diagonal. In addition, it must also be taken into account that DNA sequences must only contain the following letters (A, T, C, G).

Below you can see, as a graph, the considerations to detect if a DNA sequence corresponds to that of a mutant or that of a human mentioned above:

Here is an example of a DNA sequence corresponding to that of a mutant that meets the considerations set out above:

## MUTANT DETECTION ALGORITHM

The documentation related to the algorithm developed and implemented in the API to detect if a DNA sequence corresponds to that of a mutant or that of a human, [you can find it in the following LINK](docs/DetectionAlgorithm.md)



## ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM

The following is how the construction of this software component was planned through the following architecture diagram, in order to provide retrospective documentation, knowledge sharing and learning.

![alt text](docs/img/Img-6._Diagram_Architecture.png "Img-6. Diagram Architecture")


The previous architecture diagram identifies the following components:

### mutant-challenge-api-sprgbt

Represents the REST API in charge of receiving requests with DNA sequences, in order to detect which of these corresponds to that of a mutant or a human. And it is also in charge of providing the user with the information corresponding to the statistics in relation to the ratio between mutants and humans.


### Google Cloud DataStorage

Datastore is a very scalable NoSQL database that you can use with your applications. It automatically takes care of fragmentation and replication, giving you a durable, highly available database that scales automatically to handle the load on your applications. In addition, it offers countless functions, such as ACID transactions, SQL-like queries, indexes, and much more.

Used in this architecture to persist in it the information related to the DNA sequences tested.


### Google Cloud MemoryStorage - Redis

Memorystore for Redis provides a fully managed service for Redis in-memory data storage that allows you to create application caches to provide access to data in less than milliseconds.

Used in this architecture to persist and obtain from it the information related to the number of DNA sequences detected as mutants and as humans. To calculate the statistics related to the ratio between mutants and humans.


## AUTOMATIC TESTS

One of the development practices that characterizes a professional programmer is writing automated tests. Testing is so important that it practically defines the project development flow.

Below you can see information related to some load tests performed on the component, [accessing through the following LINK](docs/Tests.md)




## DEMO

EndPoints associated with the functionality

- [POST:/mutant](http://{url_ip}/mutant)

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -w "\n%{http_code}\n" -d '{"dna": ["ATGCGA","CAGTGC","TTATGT","AGAAGG","CCCCTA","TCACTG"]}' http://{url_ip}/v1/mutant
